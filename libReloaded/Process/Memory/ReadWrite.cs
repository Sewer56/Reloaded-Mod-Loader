                Fast     - Does not change memory page permissions with VirtualProtect. Use only if you need performance.
                External - Can be used when using the library as Standalone (outside of a Reloaded Mod Loader Mod/Injected DLL).
                Unsafe   - Does not marshal managed data to unmanaged representations. Use with truly unmanaged types only!!

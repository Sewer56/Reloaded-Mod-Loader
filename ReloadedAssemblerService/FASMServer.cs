/*
   Purpose:
   
   Allows x64, other architecture processes to assemble mnemonics via the
   FASM assembler as long as the machine supports running x86 code in any fashion.

   This is important for Reloaded mods that exist particularly in the target space
   of x64 processes, as the assembler cannot normally be used within that context
   and starting FASM.exe as a process for singular assembly jobs causes additional
   unsightly thread creation overhead.
